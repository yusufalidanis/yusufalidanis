- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ali.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in FrontEnd & BackEnd Development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python & Django.
  
- What I have been plannig here is to share what I learn through my full-stack development journey by putting into practice my blog articles lots of from academic to science, sport to everyday life, books to instructive contents while inspiring new English learners.

- We will reach these wealthy contex in different repo which will be named MyBlog.

- Last but least, as I improve myself I will merge FrontEnd & BackEnd informations to develop small but effective goal-driven tools which is most exciting and admiring part of software development.
